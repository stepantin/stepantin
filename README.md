            Hello again! I'm an iOS developer with more than 4 years of experience. I work at Aston, a company that specializes in developing applications for fintech. I write clean and elegant code in Swift, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills. I'm a perfectionist who pays attention to details and strives for excellence. I have a lot of experience working in a distributed team, and I believe that there are no impossible tasks, only lazy developers. I enjoy solving challenging problems and creating amazing products that make people's lives easier and better. You can check out some of my projects and code samples on my GitHub page. Thank you for visiting my profile and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.
